Message =The passage describes a person sneaking into a Polaroid lab during lunch and searching for anything valuable. The person stumbles upon the secret formula for Polaroid's instant film and decides to experiment with it in the lab, using a plastic cup and a mixer to blend the ingredients together. They then inject the resulting blue goo into a paper pocket, tape a piece of film negative to it, and attempt to develop it using a roller machine in a dark room. Despite uncertainty about the process, the photo develops successfully and the person proudly leaves the lab with their accomplishment, acknowledging the potential consequences of their actions.

Message =The passage discusses Iraq's history, geography, and the effects that have shaped the country. Iraq has only experienced 13 years of peace in the past four decades due to invasions, wars, and conflict caused by its geography. The geography of Iraq is centered around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and is mostly covered by the Arabian and Syrian deserts that intersect with the fertile land oasis between the rivers. The area between these 2 rivers was the historical center of civilization and inspired the age of agriculture. However, the population growth in the region leads to a fragile balance between the environment and people. Additionally, in the past century, Iraq has experienced war and conflict because their geography predisposes it to conflict. Its location is on the doorstep of mountains in the north and east, making it a region surrounded by conflict. The environment and wars have caused Iraq to have a low GDP and compared to neighboring countries.

Message =In this passage, the author discusses seven surprising ways to speed up the body's ability to burn fat. They explain that many people struggle to get into and stay in fat burning mode, but there are ways to overcome this barrier. The author explains how transitioning from running on blood sugars to being fat adapted is crucial for successful weight loss. They describe the benefits of being fat adapted, including longer periods of not feeling hungry, no longer having cravings for carbs, stable energy levels, enhanced mental activity and mood, and increased endurance during exercise. The author emphasizes that being fat adapted takes time, typically one to three months, but provides surprising tips to speed up the process. They also argue that the body was designed to burn fat, not rely on glucose, and that any glucose needed by the brain can be easily produced by the body. Ultimately, the author aims to provide readers with the necessary knowledge to reach their weight loss goals and improve overall health.
